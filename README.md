## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

MyCocoPlanner is a digital planner that aims to help you manage your life and express your own individuality creatively.

Just like paper planners, MyCocoPlanner helps you to keep track of your weekly tasks, habits, budget, to-dos, shopping list, and other aspects of your life (e.g. books or things you are passionate about). The benefit of using planners is that they make us more self-aware, and increase our productivity which gives us a feeling of fulfillment that leads to a happier life. 

You don’t want to use pen and paper? Want an environmentally friendly software? This planner could be the thing you’re looking for!
